  <p>&quot;Enlightenment is peeling   off the layers of addiction and attachment to the physical world to   see the inner workings of the soul.&quot;</p>

<p>Andrea's a   very intuitive psychic, I found her tarot reading absolutely hit the nail on the head. She really made a personal 
connection with me. After the reading, I felt grounded, and comfortable making upcoming decisions. I would highly recommend her   as a psychic and a professional.</p>

<p>Andrea is a wonderful source   of inspiration.  She gave me the confidence to take a leap of faith   and go for a promotion that I had wanted for the last 5 years.    It happened, just like she said it would!</p>

<p>My reading with Andrea helped   me to see that I was on the right path all along.  Her kind, insightful   approach made me feel at ease.  What a beautiful reading.</p>

<p>She knew things about me that   only my close friends and family would know.  Andrea is amazing.    Her confirmation of events in my life showed me that I am not alone   and that spirit is all around me.  Thank you.</p>
