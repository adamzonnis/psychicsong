	<h1>Intuitive readings by Andrea Mattson</h1>

	<p>Readings are meant to be fun and uplifting.  All of my readings are done with the intention of love, light and peace for the greater good of all.  Through the power of intent we all have the ability to create magic in our lives and carve our dreams into our destiny.</p>

	<p>Every reading is a personal experience and has relevance to what is going on in your life.  Helpful people, family and friends will often come into the readings.  As will Guardian angels, guides, spirits, and deceased loved ones.</p>

	<p>A reading will give you clarity in situations, so that you can see the moment with better understanding.  Messages will come through about the past, present and future bringing light to where healing is needed.  There is an opening that is created with in your heart that gives you the opportunity to reflect and contemplate on the deeper issues of your life.  When one is able to see themselves at a soul level, they are able to recognize their true potential.  Harmony is created by being in tune with your purpose.</p>
